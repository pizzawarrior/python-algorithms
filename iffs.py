# Correct way to compare to None
if x is None:

### One of the most important uses of is and is not is when
## we want to compare the value of a variable to the value None.
 # Correct way to compare to None
# if x is None:
#     print("x is None")

# # Incorrect way to compare to None:
# if x == None:
#     print("x is None and we shouldn't use ==")
